# Multi‑Provider Chatbot ✨

Welcome! This app lets you chat with Claude, GPT, or Gemini, and generate videos with Kling.

## Quick start

- Pick a provider from the buttons below.
- Choose a model (if needed).
- Ask your question.

## Kling generation

Select **Kling** as your provider to launch guided flows:

- **Image → Video**
- **Multi‑Image → Video** (1–4 images)

You can upload files, paste URLs, or use Base64.

## Commands

- `/new` reset chat
- `/temp 0.7` set temperature
- `/model <name>` select model
- `/provider <name>` switch provider
- `/media` view generated media history

## Notes

- Thread titles update only after the first real prompt.
- Provider/model selections never rename the thread.
